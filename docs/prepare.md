# 1. Prepare Your Project

Before deploying your library, ensure your project is structured and ready for publishing.

1. Set up your library project:

    - Create a new project or refactor an existing one into a library module.
    - Use Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA to create a module: `File -> New -> New Module -> Android Library` (for Android) or a plain Java/Kotlin library module.
2. Organize your files:

    - Place reusable code inside the library module.
    - Include clear `README.md` documentation at the root of your repository.
    - Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to specify the library's usage terms.
    - Include a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
    - Ensure your library code is well-documented and tested.
    - Add sample code or a demo app to showcase the library's features.
3. Add a `build.gradle` file:

    - Ensure your library module has a `build.gradle` file with proper dependencies and configurations.
    - Include configurations for publishing (details below).
